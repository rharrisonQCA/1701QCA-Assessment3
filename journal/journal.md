### Related project 1 ###
PuzzleBox

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/arduino/puzzlebox-c1f374?ref=search&ref_id=puzzle&offset=0

![Image](openingbox.jpg)

This project is related to mine because I would like the outcome of my game box to have a reward for solving the puzzle/problem. AS a result of this, this project is related to mine through the technology used and the function of said technology. For in both projects, a servo is used to unlock the box, revealing the reward for resolving the problem at hand. These servo’s horns would only be activated once the user completes or solves the problem through the use of lights, buttons, etc. to eventually activate the servo horns to activate and open. Therefore, this project is related to mine through its similarities of technology, function and concept.

Electronic Puzzle Box uses only Discrete Components

https://hackaday.com/2014/05/14/electronic-puzzle-box-uses-only-discrete-components/

This project is related to mine through its concept of various puzzles for the user to solve in order to open the dice container. For my project, the user will be asked to accomplish various puzzles like obtaining a specific colour, all lights to be on or off, reaching zero or a certain number while each button adjusts in random variables. However, this project also uses the tilt function of the program, which would be cool to implement into my project as a problem to solve somehow. These lead this project to be related to mine through its concept, technology and fabrication.

### Related project 3 ###
"Bomb" Diffuse Game

https://ramenboii.weebly.com/vis-147a/final-project-bomb-diffuse-game

![Image](bombgame.jpg)

This project is related to mine through it’s materials, concept and code. These can be seen through the use of a separate breadbox from the mounting plate, LEDs, cardboard and paper. The cardboard and paper in this project help with the aesthetic of the game, while my project will use this combination to form a box and be decorated with paper to be aesthetically pleasing. While this project requires the user to disconnect wires to disarm, the concept and code are similar to my game box. They are similar through having a set timer to solve the problems before the box remains forever “locked”. As well as having the same concept of having to do something to get an outcome. For this project the outcome is to prevent the bomb blowing up, while my project sees a container to open up. These projects are led to be related together through material, function and code.

Turning Lock Puzzle

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/krishnalalith/turning-lock-puzzle-356d56?ref=search&ref_id=puzzle&offset=4

![Image](lockpuzzle.jpg)

This project is related to mine due to the code used and the function that it leads to. In this project, when an individual digit is changed, the neighbours (left and right) of this digit are also changed. The function of this project sees that the user is required to change the numbers into the correct combination, with this project acting as a luggage lock. These are related to my project as I aimed to implement this type of number change into the game box, but with changing the surrounding numbers in various variable adjustments. As well as having this problem would take the user one step closer to solving the box and getting it open. As a result of this, these projects are related through concept, code and function of project.

### Related project 5 ###
Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes - Physical Edition

http://www.dillonlareau.com/projects/KTANE_physical

![Image](keeptalking.jpg)

This project is related to mine as it gave inspiration to create my own project. These two projects are also related through fabrication of projects. For this project, there is a section of the ‘bomb’ that requires the user to use their memory with the implemented lights to disarm a section. However, for this project it uses more materials and technology than what I have access to. As a result of this, it is planned to use the LED’s and alfoil to develop my own version of a pattern for the user to memorise and replicate. In the end, these projects are related through concept and fabrication as a result of inspiration.

Interactive Toddler Music Box Toy

https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/68284/interactive-toddler-music-box-toy-2c8dcf?ref=search&ref_id=box&offset=28

![Image](musicbox.jpg)

This project is related to mine through its fabrication. For starters, it is planned to design my project first with cardboard and paper to ensure the concept, technology and everything words correctly and accurately. From there, it is planned to put holes into the cardboard in order to have the LED and buttons accessible to the user ontop of the cardboard. This provides for the project to cover the wiring beneath the cardboard where it cannot be easily tangled. 

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel. This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
